# Smart-Welding-Glass-with-Auto-Shutter-Technology
Eye protection is a critical part of any job. This is because your eyes are a crucial part of your body and are incredibly sensitive. Eye injuries cost companies millions of dollars each year, and the majority of these injuries could have been prevented.
The purpose of this project is to develop a simple and convenient eye protection during welding. Nearly three out of five injured welders were not wearing eye protection at the time of the accident or were wearing the wrong kind of eye protection for the job. Eye injuries alone cost more than $300 million per year in lost production time, medical expenses and worker compensation. Welding helmets are bulky and uncomfortable. So a large number of welders risk the health of their eyes while welding.
The smart welding glass with automatic shutter technology is a good solution to this problem. Welding light is detected by an LDR. When the welding light is present, the voltage variations cause shutter to turn on and the glass becomes dark. In the absence of light, which is detected by the LDR, the shutter turns off and the glass becomes transparent again. Style, comfort, and small size are all characteristics of the smart welding glass.
The smart welding glass also has a display unit which shows working time, welding time, number of welding counts, and efficiency of the welder on the workerâ€™s android mobile phone.
